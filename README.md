# 🚀 FairWage Chain: Tokenized Supply Chain Wage Distribution

Welcome to FairWage Chain, a blockchain-powered system designed to ensure transparent and fair wage distribution for workers in global supply chains! Using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, this project tracks worker contributions on-chain, tokenizes value from product sales, and automates equitable payouts. It solves real-world issues like wage exploitation, lack of transparency, and intermediary skimming in industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and logistics.

## ✨ Features

🔄 Track supply chain stages with immutable on-chain records  
💼 Register workers and employers securely  
📊 Log verifiable worker contributions (e.g., hours, tasks completed)  
💰 Tokenize revenue from product sales for fair distribution  
⚖️ Automate wage calculations based on predefined fair-share rules  
📤 Instant, on-chain payouts to workers' wallets  
🛡️ Dispute resolution through governance voting  
🔒 Escrow for holding funds until milestones are met  
📈 Analytics for auditing wage fairness over time  
🚫 Prevent fraud with unique contribution hashes and verifications  

## 🛠 How It Works

FairWage Chain uses a network of 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to handle registration, tracking, tokenization, and distribution. Workers get paid fairly based on their logged contributions, with revenue from supply chain endpoints (e.g., product sales) tokenized and distributed proportionally.

### Smart Contracts Overview

1. **WorkerRegistry.clar**: Manages worker registrations, including identity verification and wallet associations.  
2. **EmployerRegistry.clar**: Handles employer/company onboarding, supply chain role definitions, and fund deposits.  
3. **ContributionTracker.clar**: Logs worker activities with timestamps and hashes for immutability (e.g., hours worked or units produced).  
4. **SupplyChainMilestone.clar**: Tracks product journey stages, linking contributions to specific milestones.  
5. **RevenueTokenizer.clar**: Converts incoming revenue (e.g., from sales) into fungible tokens representing wage pools.  
6. **WageCalculator.clar**: Computes fair shares based on contributions, using predefined formulas (e.g., pro-rata distribution).  
7. **PayoutDistributor.clar**: Automates token transfers to workers upon milestone completion or periodic triggers.  
8. **GovernanceEscrow.clar**: Holds funds in escrow, manages disputes via token-holder voting, and releases funds securely.

**For Workers**  
- Register via WorkerRegistry with your details and wallet.  
- Log your daily contributions (e.g., "harvested 100 units") using ContributionTracker – generate a unique hash for proof.  
- Monitor milestones in SupplyChainMilestone to see when payouts are due.  
- Receive automatic token payouts from PayoutDistributor to your wallet.  

Boom! Your wages are transparent, timely, and fair – no more waiting on shady middlemen.

**For Employers/Supply Chain Managers**  
- Onboard your company with EmployerRegistry and deposit initial funds.  
- Define supply chain stages in SupplyChainMilestone (e.g., farming → processing → shipping).  
- Tokenize revenue from sales using RevenueTokenizer.  
- Use WageCalculator to simulate distributions before approval.  
- Trigger payouts via PayoutDistributor once milestones are verified.  

Instant oversight and compliance – build trust with your workforce.

**For Verifiers/Auditors**  
- Query ContributionTracker or SupplyChainMilestone for on-chain proofs.  
- Use GovernanceEscrow to review disputes or vote on resolutions.  
- Access analytics from WageCalculator for fairness reports.  

That's it! End-to-end transparency for a more equitable world.
